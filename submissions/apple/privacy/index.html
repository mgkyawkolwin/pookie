<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-11-14</p>

<p><strong>Pookie</strong> (“the App”) is provided by <strong>"Power 9 Inter Co., Ltd."</strong> as a free service for golfers at our resort. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user information.</p>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>The App <strong>does not collect, store, or share</strong> any personal information. We do not collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Names</li>
    <li>Email addresses</li>
    <li>Phone numbers</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Device identifiers</li>
    <li>Usage analytics</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the App Works</h2>
<p>
    The App is used only to randomly generate a T-off (starting hole) assignment for golfers for the next day.
    All processing is handled on our backend server, and the room number you submit is sent securely to our API to generate a random T-off assignment.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not</strong> use any third-party services, SDKs, analytics tools, advertising libraries, or external APIs.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
    Since the App does not collect or store any personal data, there are no personal records to secure.
    However, we take reasonable measures to ensure the App is safe for users.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
    You are encouraged to review this page periodically for updates.
